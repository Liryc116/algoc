Some Algorithmic data structures and their associated functions

Such as:
	- Linked Lists
	- Derivates of linked lists (Queues and Stacks)
    - Sets
    - Dictionaries
    - Vectors
    - Matrixes
	- Binary Trees
	- BST (bin search trees), AVL and RedBlackTrees (Balanced BST)
	- General Trees
	- B-Trees
	- Graphs (both matrix and adjacent list implementation)
	- Hash tables
	

Functions are often:
	- Insertion
	- Deletion
	- Search
	
For some (Trees and graphs):
	- Depth First Search (DFS)
	- Breadth First Search (BFS)
	
Some others are:
	- Insertion for index lists/normal lists/vectors 
	- Binary Search
	- Enqueue, Dequeue and IsEmpty for queues
	
And more
